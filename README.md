# LSTM Stock Predictor

![deep-learning.jpg](deep-learning.jpg)

Because of the volatility of cryptocurrency speculation, investors will often try to incorporate sentiment from social media and news articles to help guide their trading strategies. One such indicator is the [Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG)](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) which attempts to use a variety of data sources to produce a daily FNG value for cryptocurrency. You have been asked to help build and evaluate deep learning models using both the FNG values and simple closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data.

## Instructions

### Prepare the data for training and testing


### Build and train custom LSTM RNNs


### Evaluate the performance of each model

### Hints and Considerations

Experiment with the model architecture and parameters to see which provides the best results, but be sure to use the same architecture and parameters when comparing each model.

For training, use at least 10 estimators for both models.

### Conclusion
Stock predictor closing  was a better model then the FNG model. 
There are still some modifications that can be done to create more accurate prediction since the closing model is underfit.
